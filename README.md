### 01. Pre Requirements

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Helm3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- K8S cluster - In this tutorial we will be using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

### 02. Preparation

- For this demo we need a running K8S cluster with the ability to install Helm charts
- if you are using minikube

```sh
# Start minikube
minikube start
```

#### 02.01. Prepare LDAP

- For this demo we have prepared a custom Helm chart.
- The chart is located under the [LDAP](./server/LDAP) folder.
- Install Open Ldap with Helm chart with the pre defined users for testings.

#### 02.02. Prepare LDAP Users

- You can edit the desired users in this file: [Users.ldif](./server/LDAP/Users.ldif)

```sh
# This is a sample of the a user entry
# Feel free to edit and modify the given users list
objectClass:  top
objectClass:  person
objectClass:  organizationalPerson
objectClass:  inetOrgPerson
dn:           uid=shachar,ou=users,dc=demo,dc=com
cn:           shachar
sn:           Ovadida
uid:          shachar
givenName:    Shachar
userPassword: 1234
```

#### 02.03. Install LDAP Helm chart

- As mentioned above, the chart is located under the [LDAP](./server/LDAP) folder.
- For this helm we can pass the

```sh
# Install the custom Helm
# Pass it the desired values
# The path are under this repo (inside LDAP folder)
helm  upgrade \
      --install openldap ./charts/openldap \
      --values ./values-openldap.yml \
      -n openldap
```

#### 02.04. Verify that the Helm installed correctly

- Verify that the Ldap is up and running.

```sh
# Once the helm installed you shell see the following message:
Release "openldap" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: openldap
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Nov 14 18:20:02 2021
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:

OpenLDAP has been installed. You can access the server from within the k8s cluster using:
  openldap.default.svc.cluster.local:389

```

#### 02.05. Get LDAP credentials

- In order to be able to connect to the LDAP we need to expose its port.
- We will also need the DN of the given LDAP & the [admin credentials](./server/enviorenment/ldap-admin.json).

```sh
# Get the admin credentials from the configuration file
cat ./server/enviorenment/ldap-admin.json

###
### Or
###
### Extract the credentials from the cluster secrets

# Importantly, this will include the commands for retrieving the config and administration passwords

# Admin Password
kubectl get secret --namespace openldap openldap -o jsonpath="{.data.LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode; echo

# Config password
kubectl get secret --namespace openldap openldap -o jsonpath="{.data.LDAP_CONFIG_PASSWORD}" | base64 --decode; echo
```

### # 02.06. Expose the LDAP service

```sh
# Expose the LDAP service so we wil lbe able to connect ot it
kubectl port-forward --namespace openldap \
      $(kubectl get pods -n openldap --selector='release=openldap' -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
      3890:389
```

# NodeJs

- When NodeJs starts, automatically, will try to commit a login to ldap server and database.
- make sure the ldap instructions are complete and ldap is up and running.

- There are several dependencies here, run [dependencies.sh](https://github.com/Shachar297/Ldap-GoogleAuth/blob/master/server/requirements/dependecies.sh) to install and store them.

## Flow

- Start Ldap Server
- Start NodeJs
- Once NodeJs is starting, it tries to communicate with the ldap server, Make sure ldap server is up and running.


  ```sh
  # Redirect to the server folder.
  cd server/
  # start nodejs server
  npm start
  ```

- In This example,the connection between nodejs and ldap happends automatically when node starts.

- Commit a curl to commit an http request. 

``` sh
# Commit a curl to commit an http request, to make a login request.
curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/ldap/
```

- The Login details are hard-coded within the [ldap-logic](../../server/logic/ldap-logic.js).


- If you want to change this, pass in the argument to the [ldap-controller](../../server/controllers/ldap-contoller.js) and pass it on to the next module.

- Next, for test you will be printed the google QR-code, then you will need to scan it, if logged in successfully.

- If you execute the addUser function under [ldap-controller](../../server/controllers/ldap-contoller.js), you will be needed to pair a key which sent from google.
